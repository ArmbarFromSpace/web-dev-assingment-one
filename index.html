              My favorite cocktail must be the Negroni Sbagliato, a classic

              balance.

            <h3>Sketching & Drawing</h3>
            <p>
              A casual hobby for documenting architectural details and
              mechanical layouts. I find that "reproducing" an object on paper
              is the only way to truly understand its vulnerabilities. The book
              I have been using to learn is
              <a href="https://austinkleon.com/steal/">
                Steal Like an Artist by Austin Kleon
              </a>
              - A great read for anyone looking to "remix" established ideas
              into something new.

        <h2>CAREER OBJECTIVE</h2>
        <p>
          Having spent a career navigating the complexities of industrial
          systems and fine art, I am now working toward a transition into
          viticulture. My ultimate goal is to establish a quiet, private
          vineyard in the Okanagan Valley, focusing on the production of
          small-batch vintages and the maintenance of a subterranean,
          gravity-fed aging cellar.
